`kiek` (/ˈkiːk/ - Northern German for _Look!_) is a command line tool to look into Kafka topics, especially, if they are
_complicated_, e.g.

* in AWS MSK behind IAM authentication,
* requiring assuming an IAM role,
  containing AVRO encoded messages with schemas in AWS Glue Schema Registry,
* in different development environments ...

`kiek` **analyzes the messages** in a topic, **looks up corresponding schemas** if necessary and prints the payloads
with syntax highlighting in a **human-readable format**.
